Software Engineer/Technology blogger looking for challenging problems to solve. My background is in enterprise software development, however, I have an insatiable curiosity for AI – particularly deep learning – applications and their potential to change the technology landscape.

I’m writing this blog in the hope to provide some insight into the world of an ever learning and evolving developer.

I Loved to read a novel and listen to music, especially 90's rap music.
